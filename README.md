# Spotify-top-10-songs-for-Every-artist
In this project we used a dataset from Kaggle which had a list of all artists in the world.
From which we extracted that list of artists and then used the spotify api and took a list of top 10 songs of all of those artists in the US region and made a dataset out of it.
